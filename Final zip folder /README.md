# US forest fire prediction

## Introduction:

As we are all aware, there are always too many fires in this world.  The world is constantly experiencing forest fires.   Nobody likes to hear that another one has started since, if they are not managed, they may inflict a lot of damage to the environment and the places around them, including (vegetation, buildings, residential houses, and human lives). As a result, it’s vital to catch the fire at Associate in Nursing   early.  Dry, hotter days brought on by the world’s rising   average temperature are one of the main causes of forest   fires.  The opposing causes are brought on by lightning,  thunderstorms, and carelessness on the part of people

This project will give you key insights of reasons for the forest fire are caused  and how much area its going to be effected i.e fire size class. You will find lot of analysis for the pre-processing of the dataset and why we come up with those steps with the help of profiling.
How we have applied different regression models and classifiers. why we have come up with those feature list with the help of PCA and feature importance.

The overall flow, conclusions and key insights will give you an idea of how we approached the problem statment and come up with the steps to solve it to achieve out end goal of predicting the fire-size.

## Folder structure

### Source code and dataset
- Data-set --> wildfire.csv
- Source code --> We have separated the source code for better understanding into 2 parts,
	- With-out regions file :- Will have all the pre-processing, Separation of experiments, Applying regression models to different experiments, classifiers alighned based on the dataset. For each step, you will find a comments for what it does and conclusions after that step executed.
	- With regions file :  Will have all the pre-processing, separation of polygons, separation of region dataframes, Experiments with regression models based on region and other conclusions for the regions part.

### Results
 -  Analysis results -> Will have key insights from our starting analysis of the project.
- Pre-processing results --> WIll have all the images and key results after pre-processing i.e with profiling before and after.
- Regions Results --> Will have all the results and insights related to regions.


### How to Execute:
